## Introduction

Welcome fellow visitor, 

This is the first calculater I've made back in 2019.

In this website, the technologies I've used are HTML, CSS, Javascript and React Framework.

The development of this website was greatly inspired by the Udemy's course [Web Moderno](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-web/) provided by Leonardo Moura Leitao and Cod3r Courses to whom I send a huge thanks.
